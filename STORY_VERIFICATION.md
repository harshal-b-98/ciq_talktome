## Story CGL-16 Summary

**Status:** ⚠️ MOSTLY COMPLETE - 11/13 tickets fully verified, 2 tickets pending tests

**What Works:**
- LLM provider and orchestration framework selected and integrated
- Complete type system with interfaces for all Agent operations
- Main Agent function (runAgent) fully implemented
- Prompt composition with cold-start and returning visitor strategies
- Mock vector store with 8 content entries

- Comprehensive logging with AgentLogger
- Content data output schema fully defined

**Gaps Identified:**
- ⚠️ CGL-28: Unit tests for prompt composition NOT implemented
- ⚠️ CGL-29: Integration tests for Agent NOT implemented

**Impact Assessment:**
- Tests are important for quality assurance but NOT blocking
- Agent functionality is complete and working
- Mock vector store is functioning correctly
- Tests can be added in future sprint without refactoring

**Recommendation:**
✅ Story CGL-16 meets core functional requirements
⚠️ Testing debt should be addressed before Story CGL-59 (Server Components with Agent Integration)

---

## Overall Assessment

### Story CGL-2: ✅ COMPLETE
- All 13 tickets fully implemented
- All acceptance criteria met
- Build successful, all routes working
- Ready for production use

### Story CGL-16: ⚠️ FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE
- 11/13 tickets fully implemented
- 2/13 tickets incomplete (tests only)
- Core Agent functionality working
- Testing debt identified

### Recommendation Before Proceeding to CGL-45:

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Proceed to CGL-45 with testing debt acknowledged
- Agent works correctly without tests
- Tests can be added later without blocking progress
- Focus on delivering functional features

**Option 2:** Pause and implement tests for CGL-28 and CGL-29
- Adds ~2-4 hours of work
- Improves code quality
- Delays progress to CGL-45

**Decision Required:** Should we proceed to CGL-45 or complete tests first?
